# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in POST request routes.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a vulnerable POST endpoint.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks input validation and error handling. If a client sends a malformed request (e.g., missing required fields or invalid data types), the application may crash or behave unexpectedly.  This can lead to security vulnerabilities and poor user experience.

## Solution

The solution introduces proper error handling to validate the incoming request data before processing it. This includes checking for the existence of required fields and handling potential data type mismatches.  Appropriate HTTP status codes are returned to inform the client about errors.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to run the buggy code.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to run the corrected code.
6. Test both versions using a tool like Postman.
